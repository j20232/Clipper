## Summary


## Abstract [quoted]

In this contribution, we design, implement and evaluate the pedagogicalbenefits of a novel interactive note taking interface (iVRNote) in VR for thepurpose of learning and reflection lectures. In future VR learningenvironments, students would have challenges in taking notes when they wear ahead mounted display (HMD). To solve this problem, we installed a digitaltablet on the desk and provided several tools in VR to facilitate the learningexperience. Specifically, we track the stylus position and orientation in thephysical world and then render a virtual stylus in VR. In other words, whenstudents see a virtual stylus somewhere on the desk, they can reach out withtheir hand for the physical stylus. The information provided will also enablethem to know where they will draw or write before the stylus touches thetablet. Since the presented iVRNote featuring our note taking system is adigital environment, we also enable students save efforts in taking extensivenotes by providing several functions, such as post-editing and picture taking,so that they can pay more attention to lectures in VR. We also record the timeof each stroke on the note to help students review a lecture. They can select apart of their note to revisit the corresponding segment in a virtual onlinelecture. Figures and the accompanying video demonstrate the feasibility of thepresented iVRNote system. To evaluate the system, we conducted a user studywith 20 participants to assess the preference and pedagogical benefits of theiVRNote interface.
